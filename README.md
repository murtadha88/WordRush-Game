# <h2> About WordRush
WordRush is a fast-paced and exciting word puzzle game designed to test your vocabulary and quick-thinking skills. In each level, you'll be presented with a random arrangement of letters, and your challenge is to form meaningful words before time runs out. With each completed level, the game gets progressively harder, offering more challenging letter combinations and stricter time limits. WordRush is perfect for players of all ages who love a fun and competitive brain exercise!

# <h2> Furture Plan
In the future, I plan to expand the game by introducing more levels to challenge players as they progress. Each level will bring increased difficulty, such as time constraints or more complex letter arrangements. Additionally, I aim to add more categories, including themes like countries, and professions, to diversify the gameplay and make it more engaging. This expansion will allow players to choose categories that match their interests or challenge their knowledge in different areas.
