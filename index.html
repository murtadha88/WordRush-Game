    <h2 id="sub-title">About the Game</h2>
    <p>WordRush is a fast-paced and exciting word puzzle game designed to test your vocabulary and quick-thinking skills. In each level, you'll be presented with a random arrangement of letters, and your challenge is to form meaningful words before time runs out. With each completed level, the game gets progressively harder, offering more challenging letter combinations and stricter time limits. WordRush is perfect for players of all ages who love a fun and competitive brain exercise!</p>

    <h2 id="sub-title">How To Play?</h2>
    <p>To play WordRush, carefully observe the random letters displayed on the screen. Type a valid word using these letters into the input box and press the "Submit" button to check your answer. Each level requires you to create a set number of words before the timer reaches zero. If you successfully complete the level within the time limit, you advance to the next, more challenging level. If the timer runs out, you can always try again. Stay sharp, think fast, and have fun rushing through words!</p>
